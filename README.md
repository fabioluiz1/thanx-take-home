# Rewards Redemption App

A full-stack rewards redemption web application demonstrating architecture,
coding quality, testing, and DevOps practices.

**Stack:** React + TypeScript + Ruby on Rails API + PostgreSQL + Docker +
AWS ECS/Fargate

See [architecture.md](architecture.md) for technical decisions, design
rationale, and shipping plan.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- mise (tool version manager)

Install mise:

```bash
curl https://mise.run | sh
```

### Local Development

```bash
# Install project tools
mise install

# Start all services (database, API, web)
docker-compose up

# Setup pre-commit hooks
mise run setup
```

## Deployment to AWS

### First-Time Infrastructure Setup

⚠️ Read the [AWS Setup Guide](docs/aws-setup.md) for complete prerequisites
and follow the [Deployment Steps](docs/aws-setup.md#deployment-steps).

### Continuous Deployment

After infrastructure is set up, deployments are automatic on push to `deploy`:

```bash
git push origin deploy
```

GitHub Actions will:

1. Build and push Docker images to ECR
2. Run database migrations
3. Update ECS Fargate services
4. Output service URLs

### Cleanup

Destroy all AWS infrastructure:

```bash
cd terraform
AWS_PROFILE=admin terraform destroy -auto-approve
```

**Note**: Requires AdministratorAccess profile. See
[AWS Setup Guide](docs/aws-setup.md#iam-permissions-for-terraform) for
profile requirements.
